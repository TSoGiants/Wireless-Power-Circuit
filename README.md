Planning on using: 28 AWG magnet wire.
http://www.tesla-institute.com/!app/sim/fscic.php

Coil ID: 30 mm
Number of Turns: 42
Wire diameter used: 0.32 mm
Spacing between turns: 0.05 mm (very rough guess)

Inductance (L): 101.974 uH
Coil OD: 61.079 mm
Wire length: 6.008 m


Capacitor parameters: 500 mm length x width of foil tape (~50mm).
Capacitor dielectric: wax paper (unknown permitivity).

Measured capacitance: ~9.3 nF

Resonant frequency (1/(2*pi*sqrt(L*C))): ~163.43 kHz
