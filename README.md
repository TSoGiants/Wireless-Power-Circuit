Planning on using: 28 AWG magnet wire.
http://www.tesla-institute.com/!app/sim/fscic.php

Coil ID: 30 mm
Number of Turns: 50
Wire diameter used: 0.32 mm
Spacing between turns: 0.05 mm (very rough guess)

Inductance (L): 145.61 uH (Theoretical)
Coil OD: 67 mm
Wire length: 7.618 m

Inductance (L): 417.5 uH (Practical - E05 measurements)


Capacitor parameters: 500 mm length x width of foil tape (~50mm).
Capacitor dielectric: wax paper (unknown permitivity).

Measured capacitance: ~9.3 nF

Resonant frequency (1/(2*pi*sqrt(L*C))): ~136.77 kHz (Based on theoretical L)
Resonant frequency (1/(2*pi*sqrt(L*C))): ~80.77 kHz (Based on measured L - E05)
Resonant frequency (measured) = ??
